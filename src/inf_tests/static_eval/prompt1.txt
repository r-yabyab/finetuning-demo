Write complete Java code for a simple Library Management System with the following:
1. A class `Book` with fields: `title`, `author`, and `isbn`, plus a constructor, getters, and a `toString` method.
2. A class `Library` that stores a `List<Book>` and has:
   - `addBook(Book book)`
   - `removeBookByIsbn(String isbn)`
   - `findBookByTitle(String title)` which returns a Book or null
3. A `Main` class with a `main` method that:
   - Creates a Library
   - Adds at least two books
   - Finds a book by title and prints it
   - Removes a book by ISBN
   - Prints remaining books
The code should be fully self-contained in one file, but still contain these three separate classes.
