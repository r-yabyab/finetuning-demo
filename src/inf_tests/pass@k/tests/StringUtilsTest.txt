Write a complete Java class named StringUtils that:
1. Has a public class declaration: `public class StringUtils {`
2. Has a public instance method `reverseString(String input)` that returns the reversed version of the input string
3. Has a public instance method `isPalindrome(String input)` that returns true if the string reads the same forwards and backwards (case-insensitive)
4. Has a public instance method `countVowels(String input)` that returns the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string (case-insensitive)
5. Handles null inputs appropriately (return null for reverseString, false for isPalindrome, 0 for countVowels)

The class should work with JUnit tests where:
- Methods are called on an instance: `StringUtils utils = new StringUtils();`
- Edge cases like null, empty strings, and special characters are tested

Example structure:
```java
public class StringUtils {
    // your methods here
}
```
