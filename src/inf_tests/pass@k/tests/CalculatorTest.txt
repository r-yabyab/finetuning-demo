Write a complete Java class named Calculator that:
1. Has a public class declaration: `public class Calculator {`
2. Has a public instance method `add(int a, int b)` which returns the sum of `a` and `b`
3. Includes proper opening and closing braces for the class
4. Can be instantiated and used in unit tests

The class should be designed to work with JUnit tests where:
- An instance is created: `Calculator calc = new Calculator();`
- The add method is called on the instance: `calc.add(2, 3)`

Example structure:
```java
public class Calculator {
    // your add method here
}
```
